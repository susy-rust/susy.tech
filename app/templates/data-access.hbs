  <h1>Accessing the Susy.tech Data</h1>
</div>

<p>
  There are several ways of accessing the Susy.tech data. You should try the
  options in the order listed.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>
      The <a href='https://github.com/susy-rust/susy.tech-index'>susy.tech index</a>.
    </b>
    This git repository is updated by susy.tech, and it is used
    by Cargo to speed up local dependency resolution. It contains the majority
    of the data exposed by susy.tech and is cheap to clone and get updates.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>The database dumps (experimental).</b> The dump contains all information
    exposed by the API in a single download. It is updated every 24 hours.
    The latest dump is available at the address
    <a href='https://static.susy.tech/db-dump.tar.gz'>https://static.susy.tech/db-dump.tar.gz</a>.
    Information on using the dump is contained in the tarball.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Crawl the susy.tech API.</b> This should be used as a last resort, and
    doing so is subject to our {{#link-to 'policies'}}crawling policy{{/link-to}}.
    If the index and the database dumps do not satisfy your needs, we're happy to
    discuss solutions that don't require you to crawl the registry.
    You can email us at <a href="mailto:help@susy.tech">help@susy.tech</a>.
